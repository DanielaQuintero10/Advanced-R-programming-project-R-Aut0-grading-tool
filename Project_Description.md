## **RAutoGrader: Automatic R Code Testing Tool**
RAutoGrader is a project developed by students of the Masters in Data Science and Business Analytics program at the University of Warsaw. The aim of the project is to provide an automatic checking system for students' R code, which allows for collecting and automatically grading coding tasks and close-ended questions.

The tool includes support for a variety of programming concepts, including writing advanced functions, object-oriented programming, use of C++, vectorization, Shiny dashboards, and package creation. The automatic grading system is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to use, and can be integrated with learning management systems such as Moodle.

This repository contains the source code for RAutoGrader, along with documentation, tests, and examples. Contributions and feedback are welcome, and we encourage interested developers and educators to get involved and help us improve the tool.
